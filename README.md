# MMBR.IO Enrolment Plugin

## What is MMBR.IO?

MMBR.IO is a payment gateway that pays out in 25 countries and accepts multiple currencies. Foxtrot (by MMBR.IO) is the product designed specifically for use with Moodle™ courses.

## What makes MMBR.IO a great payment gateway for Moodle?

Foxtrot lets you require one-time or recurring payments to enrol in your course. eg. For $25/month (or any amount you choose), the enrolled student has access to the course. If the subscription (or recurring payment) fails or stops, the student’s access to the course will be suspended until payment resumes.

This enrolment plugin requires a verified MMBR.IO account. It’s free, takes only minutes to set up. https://dashboard.mmbr.io/register
